All but one are using max()[1]. One case uses max_t() to get u32.

I much prefer explicit typing, but both you and Rasmus mentioned
wanting the int/sizeof_t mixing. I'm totally happy with const_max_t()
-- even if it makes my line-wrapping harder due to the longer name. ;)

I'll resend in a moment...
