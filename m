Hmm. That makes sense. It just doesn't work for our case when we
really want to choose the expression based on side effects or not.

The silly thing is, the thing we *really* want to know _is_ actually
easily accessible during the early parsing, exactly like
__builtin_compatible_p(): it's not really that we care about the
expressions being constant, as much as the "can this have side
effects" question.

We only really use __builtin_constant_p() as a (bad) approximation of
that in this case, since it's the best we can do.

So the real use would be to say "can we use the simple direct macro
that just happens to also fold into a nice integer constant
expression" for __builtin_choose_expr().

I tried to find something like that, but it really doesn't exist, even
though I would actually have expected it to be a somewhat common
concern for macro writers: write a macro that works in any arbitrary
environment.

I guess array sizes are really the only true limiting environment
(static initializers is another one).

How annoying. Odd that newer gcc's seem to do so much better (ie gcc-5
seems to be fine). So _something_ must have changed.
