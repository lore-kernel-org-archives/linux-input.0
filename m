It also depends upon "ICE for null pointer constant purposes" having the
same extensions as "ICE for enum purposes", etc., which is not obvious.

Back in 2007 or so we had a long thread regarding null pointer constants
in sparse; I probably still have notes from back then, but that'll take
some serious digging to find ;-/

What's more, gcc definitely has odd extensions.  Example I remember from
back then:
extern unsigned n;
struct {
	int x : 1 + n - n;
} y;

is accepted.  Used to be quietly accepted with -Wpedantic -std=c99, even,
but that got fixed - with -Wpedantic it does, at least, warn.  What is
and what is not recognized is fairly random - 1 + n - n + 1 + n - n
is recognized as "constant", 1 + n + n + 1 - n - n is not.  Of course,
neither is an ICE.
