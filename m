Not really. We do rely on builtin_constant_p not being folded too
quickly to a 0/1 answer, so that gcc still generates good code even if
the argument is only known to be constant at a late(r) optimization
stage (through inlining and all). So unlike types_compatible_p, which
can obviously be answered early during parsing, builtin_constant_p is
most of the time a yes/no/maybe/it's complicated thing. Sure, when the
argument is just a literal or perhaps even any kind of ICE, gcc can fold
it to "yes", and I think it does (though the details of when and if gcc
does that can obviously be very version-dependent, which may be some of
what we've seen). But when it's not that obvious, gcc leaves it in the
undetermined state. That's not good enough for builtin_choose_expr,
because even the type of the resulting expression depends on that first
argument, so that really must be resolved early.

So to have some kind of builtin_constant_p control a
builtin_choose_expr, it would need to be a "builtin_ice_p" or
"builtin_obviously_constant_p" that would always be folded to 0/1 as
part of evaluating ICEs.

So I don't think there's any way around creating a separate macro for
use with compile-time constants.
