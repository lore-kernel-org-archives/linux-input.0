Then the Documentation in this patch better be fixed up, as it points to
the input device as having these sysfs files :)

But as these are input device attributes, and not USB device interface
attributes, putting them on the USB interface doesn't make much sense,
and as I pointed out, is racy.  Why can't input devices have
driver-specific attributes?  Why does input devices add their own
attributes sometimes (like in psmouse, which does so in a racy way) yet
this driver shouldn't do that?

Hm, nevermind about psmouse, that happens on the parent device too it
seems (a serio device), not the input device, so it is "consistent", but
not something I really like...

thanks,
