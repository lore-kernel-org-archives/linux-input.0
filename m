What kinds of changes in time_t? Extending it to 64-bits in both kernel
and userspace? Ok, I get confused here, if there are some sample codes
or use-cases here, it will help me a lot.

It seems we are mismatch here.

Actually input_composite_event has the similar structure with input_eve=
nt,
but with a nicer definition, which can take both monotonic and non-mono=
tonic
timestamps safely.

What I assumed here, is that leaving EV_IF_LEGACY as a untouched, depre=
cated
interface. If userspace try to adapt to new libc and kernel, it should =
move
to new interface. The userspace can do a lazy update, keep the code unt=
ouched,
but suffer the y2038 problem by itself.

We can force kernel using monotonic time in EV_IF_LEGACY interface, and
making input_event independent from time_t(after evdev has converted to
input_value, it=A1=AFs easy to do that), but that also imply userspace
must change their code to fit this change. If changing userspace code i=
s
a mandatory option, why not to force them do a complete conversion?
