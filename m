I think it is historical as quite often they (attributes) affect the
hardware itself, not behavior of input interface. And so they were
always placed on hardware level, not input device level.

Anyway, I do not think you are going to win your war on sysfs attributes
created post-device creation. We just need to recognize that there are
attributes that are created by the driver when it is bound to the
device. Maybe we need to revisit the idea about emitting special uevent
when driver is fully bound to a device and interested userspace can
start using it.

Thanks.
