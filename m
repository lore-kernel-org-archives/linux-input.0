I find this commit message confusing.  VLAs have precisely defined 
semantics which differ from other arrays, and these differences can be 
observable (maybe not in the kernel, but certainly for userspace), so 
the compiler has to treat a VLA as such even if the length is a constant 
known at compile time.  (The original intent of the warning probably was 
a portability check anyway.)

If you want to catch stack frames which have unbounded size, 
-Werror=stack-usage=1000 or -Werror=vla-larger-than=1000 (with the 
constant adjusted as needed) might be the better approach.

Thanks,
Florian
