That seems reasonable. I have prepared a (little more cleaned up) v5 of
the patch and moved it to staging, with a TODO file containing also the
current documentation. I hope to be able to do the iio integration
sometime "soon", but this could speed things up.

That's totally fine. Of course iio is the way to go. I had the driver
before I really knew iio and this was lazyness (when I found
Documentation/ABI/testing), plus the desire to publish it before the
chip itself is deprecated.
