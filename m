I have split the special functions between backlight and macro function=
s. This should make it easier to test new devices. I think the macro fu=
nctions will only be reused with the K95. While backlight is more commo=
n feature, though I have no idea it is done with other Corsair hardware=
=2E

I have changed most sysfs attributes and LEDs so that the current value=
 is queried from the hardware instead of tracking events. I started thi=
s way when I did not know how to read the value, but I think it is bett=
er done this way when I can. I don't know how to read the state of the =
record LED, so this one still use events to update the state.

I removed the color from the LEDs name. I understand it is only necessa=
ry when having LEDs with several colors. This way the names will stay t=
he same across different hardware with different backlight color. I don=
't think it is an useful information here.

I also added event for the MR (macro record) button and profile switch =
buttons. I think that userspace program may want to know about these ev=
ents. For example for using profile keys to start some configuration pr=
ogram.

changes in v3:
- query the hardware instead of tracking the value with events when pos=
sible (except record_led)
- added quirks for activating special functions (macro functions and ba=
cklight)
- allocation  of led name use kzalloc instead of devm_kzalloc (free mem=
 when initialization failed)
- renamed led devices (without colors)
- added key codes for record and profile keys
