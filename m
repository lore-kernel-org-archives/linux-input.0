We don't change time_t in the kernel, we just try to replace it
with time64_t, or ktime_t where appropriate.

What I meant is the problem when glibc defines their time_t to
be 'long long' so that user space can be built that runs after
2038. This changes the timeval and timespec definitions, so
a process that tries to use 'struct input_event' has a different
layout compared to what the kernel has.

I though that we had already discussed that multiple times.

=46orcing the move to the new API is very ugly, because you can't do it
in a way that works on old kernels as well, unless you then try to supp=
ort
both APIs at runtime.

Just requiring user space to switch to monotonic time is easily done,
as it can likely work either way.

Most user space programs won't care, as they don't even look at the tv_=
sec
portion, and the goal is to avoid having to change them.

There is still an open question to how exactly we want to get user spac=
e
to change.

We could do some compile-time trick by having a union in struct input_e=
vent
and mark the existing timeval part as deprecated, so we flag any use of=
 the
32-bit tv_sec member, such as:

struct input_event {
#if !defined(__KERNEL__) && __TIME_T_BITS =3D=3D __BITS_PER_LONG
        struct timeval time;
#else
	struct {
		union {
			__u32 tv_sec __attribute__((deprecated));
			__u32 tv_sec_monotonic;
		};
		__s32 tv_usec;
	} time;
#endif
        __u16 type;
        __u16 code;
        __s32 value;
};

Another option is to do a runtime change, and always set the time field
to zero when the kernel is built without support for 32-bit time_t
and user space has not yet called the ioctl to change to monotonic time=
=2E

We can also do a combination of the two.
