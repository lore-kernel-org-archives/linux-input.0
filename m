I think we're still talking past one another. I thought we had establis=
hed
that

1. the current interface is broken when time_t changes in user space
2. we can fix it by redefining struct input_event in a way that
   is independent of time_t
3. once both user space and kernel are using the same ABI independent
   of time_t, we can look improving the timestamps so they don't
   overflow
4. the monotonic timestamp interface already avoids the overflow, so
   it would be sufficient as a solution for 3.

Where did I lose you here? Did you find any other facts that I
was missing? I don't know whether the two new event structures make
the interface better in some other way, but it seems mostly unrelated
to either of the two problems we already have with time_t (the
ABI mismatch, and the use of non-monotonic timestamps).
