You can't use both interrupt lines. You have to decide on one and all
your selected interrupt sources will be on this one line.

It's active low per default. I investigated and couldn't successfully
use active high. In v4 of the patch, this option is gone and documented.

First, I don't really want to expand the sysfs ABI much. Second, there
are use cases that don't need these at runtime and it would seem to make
it even harder for systems to use this driver.

I use "dynamic-range" in v4 of the patch.

this is better documented in v4 of the patch.
