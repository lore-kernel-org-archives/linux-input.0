The problem I see with this approach is that it still breaks any
legacy source code that is compiled with a new libc that uses 64-bit
time_t. If we are requiring source code changes for building users
of input devices with a new libc, we can easily get them to handle
the overflow (they normally only care about the microsecond portion
anyway, so it doesn't matter in most cases), or to use monotonic time.

Did I miss something here?
