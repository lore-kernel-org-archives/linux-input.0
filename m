Indeed, we missed that. We should probably also notify the HIDP
developers as "struct hidp_connadd_req" suffers from the same
problems. (CC'ed)

The only users I am aware of is an HID debugging tool and experimental
HoG Bluetooth support (bluez). Maybe Marcel or Johan can comment
whether this is already used by bluez-5? If it is, then we shouldn't
break ABI and go with #2+#3. Otherwise, I think changing to u64 should
be ok.
On the other hand, it would break any future build for older stable
kernels so not breaking ABI is probably the best idea. Any comments? I
can add a COMPAT fix and a comment to fix this in the next version of
UHID_CREATE.

Thanks!
David
