Correct, this is a useful side-effect of the change: any user space acc=
ess to
the event->time member that assumes it's a timeval will cause a compile=
-time
warning or error (depending on the access), which helps us identify the
broken code and fix it to use monotonic times as well as access the rig=
ht
struct members.

We can't really remove this instance of timeval anyway, so adding an __=
s64 member
here is not all that helpful. We should use __s64 nanoseconds for new i=
nterfaces
like this, but I see no reason to change the one we have here.
