I removed the k90_profile class completely. I cannot write a good enoug=
h ABI with what I know of the keyboard so I am leaving that part out of=
 the kernel. If I change my mind in the future, it will be done in anot=
her patch.

I also fixed a bug I had when unregistering the led device. Work was be=
ing scheduled after the led device was unregistered.

On the name change, I kept a lot of K90 references. As far as I know, t=
he only similar keyboard is the K60 that shares the same firmware but d=
oes not have all the special keys and backlight, and for which the hid-=
generic driver should be enough. The more recent RGB keyboard series us=
es a different protocol from what I have seen from the unofficial users=
pace driver (CKB from MSC).

changes in v2:
 - Removed the k90_profile class and devices
 - Renamed driver for a more generic name ("corsair" driver in hid-cors=
air.c)
 - Fixed led devices clean up (hang when unplugging and led state reset=
)
 - Added dependency on USB and LEDS_CLASS in Kconfig
