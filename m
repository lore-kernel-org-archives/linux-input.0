 the only similar keyboard is the K60 that shares the same firmware but=
 does not have all the special keys and backlight, and for which the hi=
d-generic driver should be enough. The more recent RGB keyboard series =
uses a different protocol from what I have seen from the unofficial use=
rspace driver (CKB from MSC).
Actually, I may have been wrong, other keyboard may share at least the =
incorrect HID usage code part. I will investigate more and send a new p=
atch. I am still interested in comments on this one, especially on the =
choice of key codes for the programmable keys.
