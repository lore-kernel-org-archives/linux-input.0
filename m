It's probably worth pull Dmitry in on this conversation as well (and maybe
the input list). cc'd.

For reference of those who haven't seen this before.  The question here is about
exposing the sensor mounting matrix ( orientation of the sensor frame of reference
relative to some 'magic' orientation - probably the PCB )

Note I'd also throw in here that I'd argue for a combined R T matrix
e.g. [R T] so as to cover cases where we care about the position as well as the
orientation relative to some reference point.  A class case in point would
be rotation measurement from offset accelerometers.

Could go with a full projective geometry matrix, but probably better to keep it
in some base scale e.g.
[R   T]
[000 1]
but not bother exporting the 000 1 as it'll always be the same.


Note I've written this email whilst without net access (free wifi at
Stansted airport is rubbish!) so haven't checked out the existing ACPI ABI.
Will try and remember to do this when I get a moment with working internet.
