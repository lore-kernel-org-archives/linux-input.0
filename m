there is
http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=RDMMA865x&lang_cd=
and http://linux-sunxi.org/Inet_K970 for example. I think I saw Android
devices with it too, and I would guess it would be used more often if it
were in linux.

Please refer to v4 of the patch for different questions. thanks!
