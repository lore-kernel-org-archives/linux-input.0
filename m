FWIW, 6.6 starts with
	 constant-expression:
		conditional-expression
for syntax, with 6.6p3 being "Constant expression shall not contain
assignment, increment, decrement, function call or comma operators,
except when they are contained in a subexpression that is not evaluated",
with "The operand of sizeof operator is usually not evaluated (6.5.3.4)"
as a footnote.

6.6p10 allows implementation to accept other forms of constant expressions,
but arguing that such-and-such construct surely must be recognized as one,
when there are perfectly portable ways to achieve the same...

Realistically, code like that can come only from macros, and one can wrap
the damn thing into 0 * sizeof(..., 0) + just fine there.  Which will
satisfy the conditions for sizeof argument not being evaluated...
