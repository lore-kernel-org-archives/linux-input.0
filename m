I am going to say again (in a different way) what Bastien said. In its
current form, even in drivers/misc, this is a NACK for me (v1, v2, v3
& v4).

Putting a driver in Linux means we have to support it forever, and
definitively, nobody will use an accelerometer in Android if it is in
drivers/misc.
Android requires drivers to follow the IIO protocol. Period.
So having your own will not help android, it will just be a burden.

The sysfs you are proposing seems simple enough, but we can not afford
having a 3rd custom way of relying the accelerometer information in
the Linux tree (they were first handled in input, then IIO, then a
custom sysfs).

If you really want to have the driver in the tree, I won't be opposed
if you put in under staging. This way, you can break it whenever you
want and people won't rely on it. And then, we can use your driver as
a base to port it to IIO.

Sorry for being rude, but I am starting to get tired of people saying
that they don't have the time to follow what the reviewers said. You
obviously spent some time polishing this driver, why not making it
right from its first inclusion in the tree?

Cheers,
Benjamin
